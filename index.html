<p><img src="img/eithealth_innostqars.jpeg" alt="EIT Health InnoStars Logo"></p>
<h3>Accelerating XR Innovation in European Healthcare</h3>
<p>The VR HEALTH CHAMPIONS project aims to accelerate the market uptake of five &quot;Flagship SMEs&quot; developing innovative Extended Reality (XR) healthcare solutions. By providing these SMEs with essential resources and support, the project addresses market barriers, advances the technological readiness of their innovations, and assists in creating solid business plans for commercialization. The ultimate goal is to help these SMEs reach TRL 9 (actual system proven in an operational environment), navigate regulatory processes like CE marking, and successfully enter the European healthcare market.</p>
<h3>Work Package 7: Value Chain Integration</h3>
<p>Work Package 7 (WP7) plays a critical role in coordinating collaborative efforts and ensuring flagship SMEs receive necessary support to achieve market readiness. Led by INN with participation from all project partners, WP7 encompasses the following key tasks:</p>
<h4>Key Tasks:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>T7.1: Business &amp; Investment Roadmap:</strong> Co-creation of detailed roadmaps for each flagship SME</li>
<li><strong>T7.2: Challenge Definition for Cascade Funding Scheme:</strong> Identifying specific challenges and technical expertise needs</li>
<li><strong>T7.3: 1st Cascade Funding Scheme:</strong> Organization, promotion, and management of open calls</li>
<li><strong>T7.4: 2nd Cascade Funding Scheme:</strong> Focusing on early-stage startups developing VR/AR healthcare solutions</li>
<li><strong>T7.5: Monitoring &amp; Evaluation:</strong> Using CIMIT&#39;s HealthTech Innovation Cycle methodology</li>
<li><strong>T7.6: Final Business &amp; Investment Plans:</strong> Supporting flagship SMEs in creating comprehensive plans for wide-scale commercialization</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Aspects of WP7:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaborative Approach:</strong> Emphasizing co-creation and joint implementation with all partners</li>

</ul>
<p>WP7 is crucial in enabling flagship SMEs to achieve market success and contribute to the advancement of VR/AR healthcare solutions in Europe. It coordinates collaborative efforts, attracts additional expertise, and focuses on long-term impact and sustainability.</p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The adoption of Extended Reality (XR) technologies in healthcare faces significant barriers, particularly affecting innovative SMEs. Our five Flagship SMEs encounter unique challenges in bringing their XR healthcare solutions to market.</p>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<h3>Unique Methodology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quadruple Helix Approach:</strong> Bringing together academia, industry, government, and civil society for comprehensive innovation</li>
<li><strong>Interregional Collaboration:</strong> Connecting less developed regions with advanced ecosystems to bridge the innovation gap</li>
<li><strong>Cascade Funding:</strong> Engaging additional SMEs to expand the XR healthcare ecosystem and provide specialized expertise</li>
</ul>
<h3>CIMIT&#39;s HealthTech Innovation Cycle</h3>
<p>A key component of our methodology is the use of <a href="https://www.cimit.org/">CIMIT&#39;s</a> HealthTech Innovation Cycle for monitoring progress across technology, regulatory, marketing/business, and clinical domains. Through this structured approach, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systematically assess the progress of our Flagship SMEs</li>
<li>Identify potential barriers or challenges across different domains</li>
<li>Tailor our support to address specific needs in technology development, regulatory compliance in Europe, market strategy, or clinical validation</li>
<li>Ensure a holistic approach to innovation that considers all aspects of bringing a healthcare solution to market</li>
</ul>
