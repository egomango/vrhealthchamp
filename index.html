                <h3>Accelerating XR Innovation in European Healthcare</h3>
                <p>
                    The VR HEALTH CHAMPIONS project aims to accelerate the
                    market uptake of five "Flagship SMEs" developing innovative
                    Extended Reality (XR) healthcare solutions. By providing
                    these SMEs with essential resources and support, the project
                    addresses market barriers, advances the technological
                    readiness of their innovations, and assists in creating
                    solid business plans for commercialization. The ultimate
                    goal is to help these SMEs reach TRL 9 (actual system proven
                    in an operational environment), navigate regulatory
                    processes like CE marking, and successfully enter the
                    European healthcare market.
