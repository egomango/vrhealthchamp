### Accelerating XR Innovation in European Healthcare

The VR HEALTH CHAMPIONS project aims to accelerate the market uptake of five "Flagship SMEs" developing innovative Extended Reality (XR) healthcare solutions. By providing these SMEs with essential resources and support, the project addresses market barriers, advances the technological readiness of their innovations, and assists in creating solid business plans for commercialization. The ultimate goal is to help these SMEs reach TRL 9 (actual system proven in an operational environment), navigate regulatory processes like CE marking, and successfully enter the European healthcare market.

### Work Package 7: Value Chain Integration

Work Package 7 (WP7) plays a critical role in coordinating collaborative efforts and ensuring flagship SMEs receive necessary support to achieve market readiness. Led by INN with participation from all project partners, WP7 encompasses the following key tasks:

#### Key Tasks:
- **T7.1: Business & Investment Roadmap:** Co-creation of detailed roadmaps for each flagship SME
- **T7.2: Challenge Definition for Cascade Funding Scheme:** Identifying specific challenges and technical expertise needs
- **T7.3: 1st Cascade Funding Scheme:** Organization, promotion, and management of open calls
- **T7.4: 2nd Cascade Funding Scheme:** Focusing on early-stage startups developing VR/AR healthcare solutions
- **T7.5: Monitoring & Evaluation:** Using CIMIT's HealthTech Innovation Cycle methodology
- **T7.6: Final Business & Investment Plans:** Supporting flagship SMEs in creating comprehensive plans for wide-scale commercialization

#### Key Aspects of WP7:
- **Collaborative Approach:** Emphasizing co-creation and joint implementation with all partners
- **Focus on Impact and Sustainability:** Guiding flagship SMEs towards market readiness and creating a supportive ecosystem
- **Cascade Funding:** Expanding project reach and attracting additional expertise
- **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Incorporating rigorous mechanisms to track progress and assess effectiveness

WP7 is crucial in enabling flagship SMEs to achieve market success and contribute to the advancement of VR/AR healthcare solutions in Europe. It coordinates collaborative efforts, attracts additional expertise, and focuses on long-term impact and sustainability.

## The Challenge

The adoption of Extended Reality (XR) technologies in healthcare faces significant barriers, particularly affecting innovative SMEs. Our five Flagship SMEs encounter unique challenges in bringing their XR healthcare solutions to market.

## Our Solution

### Unique Methodology
- **Quadruple Helix Approach:** Bringing together academia, industry, government, and civil society for comprehensive innovation
- **Interregional Collaboration:** Connecting less developed regions with advanced ecosystems to bridge the innovation gap
- **Cascade Funding:** Engaging additional SMEs to expand the XR healthcare ecosystem and provide specialized expertise

### CIMIT's HealthTech Innovation Cycle

A key component of our methodology is the use of [CIMIT's](https://www.cimit.org/) HealthTech Innovation Cycle for monitoring progress across technology, regulatory, marketing/business, and clinical domains. Through this structured approach, we:
- Systematically assess the progress of our Flagship SMEs
- Identify potential barriers or challenges across different domains
- Tailor our support to address specific needs in technology development, regulatory compliance in Europe, market strategy, or clinical validation
- Ensure a holistic approach to innovation that considers all aspects of bringing a healthcare solution to market

## Flagship SMEs

The VR HEALTH CHAMPIONS project supports five innovative SMEs, each developing cutting-edge XR solutions for healthcare. Our goal is to help these companies achieve Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 9, with their products fully developed and proven in operational environments.

### Hardware Solutions

#### MedApp (Poland)

A surgical navigation solution using Microsoft HoloLens 2 for 3D visualization of medical data.

#### Lightspace Optical Reality (Latvia)

A next-generation AR headset designed specifically for medical use cases.

### Healthcare Applications

#### MEEVA (Italy)

Therapeutic VR games for rehabilitation of teenagers with neurodevelopmental disorders.

#### Metaskills (Poland)

A platform for soft skills development in healthcare professionals.

#### Virtuleap (Portugal)

A VR-based cognitive assessment tool for detecting early signs of cognitive decline.

VR HEALTH CHAMPIONS provides these SMEs with essential support services, including data access, AI/ML enhancement, UI/UX design, regulatory guidance, market uptake strategies, and more. By addressing their unique challenges, we aim to accelerate their growth and foster a thriving XR healthcare ecosystem in Europe.

## WP7 T7.1 - T.7.6 Implementation

### Platform: Armstrong

The VR HEALTH CHAMPIONS project utilizes the Armstrong platform to accelerate the progress of Flagship SMEs from CIMIT 6 to CIMIT 9 in the Healthcare Innovation Cycle.

#### Key Steps for Platform Setup:
- Configure and setup Armstrong acceleration workflow from CIMIT 6 to CIMIT 9
- Onboard Flagship SMEs
- Add supporting partners as service providers
- Add mentors and stakeholders
- Configure and setup reporting



By leveraging the Armstrong platform and following this structured approach, VR HEALTH CHAMPIONS aims to efficiently guide Flagship SMEs through the critical stages of healthcare innovation, from initial clinical trials to widespread clinical use and market success.

VR HEALTH CHAMPIONS represents a strategic initiative to accelerate the adoption of XR technologies in European healthcare. Through our structured support program, carefully selected consortium of partners, and innovative methodologies, we are creating a sustainable ecosystem for healthcare innovation. The project not only supports individual SMEs in their journey to market but also establishes a replicable model for future healthcare technology development and commercialization in Europe.

Our coordinated approach through Work Package 7 ensures that each Flagship SME receives comprehensive support while contributing to the broader goal of transforming healthcare delivery through XR technologies. As we progress from the kick-off phase, we remain committed to fostering innovation, facilitating collaboration, and ultimately improving patient care across Europe.
